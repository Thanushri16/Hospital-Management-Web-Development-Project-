# Hospital-Management-Web-Development-Project
Aim:

The Hospital Management System (HMS) is designed for Any Hospital to replace their existing manual, paper-based system. The new system is to control the following information; patient and doctor information, patient invoices and making appointments. These services are to be provided in an efficient, cost effective manner, with the goal of reducing the time and resources currently required for such tasks.

Objective:

Hospitals currently use a manual system for the management and maintenance of critical information. The current system requires numerous paper forms, with data stores spread throughout the hospital management infrastructure. Often information (on forms) is incomplete, or does not follow management standards. Forms are often lost in transit between departments requiring a comprehensive auditing process to ensure that no vital information is lost. Multiple copies of the same information exist in the hospital and may lead to inconsistencies in data in various data stores.
